# Number Properties Checker

## Overview

This Dart program determines the properties of each number in a list of integers. Specifically, it checks whether each number is:

1. Positive or negative.
2. Even or odd.

The program uses a combination of conditional checks and prints the results for each number in the list.

## Code Details

### Core Logic

1. Iterate through the list of integers using a `for` loop.
2. For each number:
    - Compute the remainder when divided by 2 to determine if it is even or odd.
    - Check if the number is greater than 0 to classify it as positive or negative.
3. Print the results in a formatted output.

### Output Example

For the provided list of integers, the output will be:
